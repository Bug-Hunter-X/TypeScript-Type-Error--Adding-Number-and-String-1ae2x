# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that occurs when attempting to add a number and a string without explicit type conversion. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument, resulting in a type error.

The solution involves adding type checking and explicit type conversion to handle potential type mismatches.
